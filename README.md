# Budget-App
freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python project

The goal of this project:

Complete the Category class in budget.py. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category. The class should have an instance variable called ledger that is a list.

Besides the Category class, create a function (outside of the class) called create_spend_chart that takes a list of categories as an argument. It should return a string that is a bar chart.

Joao_Solved provides my proposed working solution. The following files are the ones used by freeCodeCamp to check whether it's a valid solution
